# OpenScaler
OpenScale is an open-source desktop application for applying real-world dimensions to images. Calibrate scale using a known-length reference, draw precise lines with snapping, annotate distances (including parallel spacing), adjust colors, crop in various shapes, and export annotated images to print-ready PDFs for different paper sizes.
